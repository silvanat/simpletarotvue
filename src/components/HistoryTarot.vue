          The term “tarot” and the German word “Tarock” both have their origins
          in the Italian word “Tarocchi,” although the exact origin remains
          uncertain. Tarot refers to a deck of playing cards that has been in
          use since at least the mid-15th century across various parts of Europe
          for playing card games like Tarocchini.

        <p class="mb-6">
          In the late 18th century, French occultists made elaborate but
          unverified claims about the history and significance of tarot cards,
          leading to the creation of customized decks specifically for
          divination through tarot card readings and cartomancy. As a result,
          there are two distinct types of tarot decks in circulation: those
          designed for card games and those intended for divination.
          Occasionally, older patterns like the Tarot de Marseille, originally
          meant for playing card games, are also used for cartomancy.

          The standard modern tarot deck is based on either the Venetian or the
          Piedmontese tarot. It comprises 78 cards divided into two main groups:
          the major arcana (also known as trumps), consisting of 22 cards, and
          the minor arcana, which includes 56 cards. The major arcana cards
          depict various forces, characters, virtues, and vices. These 22 cards
          are numbered from I to XXI, with the Fool card remaining unnumbered.
